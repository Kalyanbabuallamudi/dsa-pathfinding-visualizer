# Pathfinding Visualizer

A React-based pathfinding visualizer designed to showcase various graph search algorithms (like Dijkstra, A*, BFS, DFS) using tree nodes for educational purposes. This project visualizes the process of pathfinding, allowing users to interactively select the algorithm and visualize the shortest path through tree nodes. Users can also check live updates of the algorithm's process in the browser console.

## Features

- **Interactive Tree Nodes**: Users can select nodes, set start/end points, and add obstacles to create a tree-like structure for pathfinding.
- **Pathfinding Algorithms**: Supports Dijkstra, A*, BFS, and DFS algorithms to find the shortest path.
- **Live Updates (Algorithm Insights)**: See live algorithm updates directly in the browser console for detailed insights into each step of the algorithm.
- **Animation Control**: Speed control for algorithm animations (slow, medium, fast).
- **Responsive UI**: The app is fully responsive and works on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Watch the algorithm search and visualize the pathfinding process in real-time.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **State Management**: React State (Context API/UseState)
- **Animation**: CSS animations
- **Styling**: CSS3, Flexbox, and custom tree node styling for interactive visualization
